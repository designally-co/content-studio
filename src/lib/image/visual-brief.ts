 * had to weigh, and together they buried the only thing that turned out to
 * matter: a real photograph of the situation, and an image of the same kind.
 *
 * What is left is that, and nothing else. An article about designers working
 * with AI finds a photograph of a designer at a desk and produces a picture of
 * a designer at a desk — a different person, a different room, the same kind
 * of picture. No metaphor, no framing preset, no mode to choose.
