 * from whatever it is given.
 *
 * It returns the bytes it actually wrote along with their dimensions, because
 * the caller records width and height on the row. Measuring the input would
 * file the ORIGINAL's dimensions against a file that is no longer that size —
 * and dimensions drive the cover's aspect ratio on the Hub, so the error would
 * surface as a cropped or letterboxed cover rather than as a wrong number.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT applied to reference photographs, which take the same
 * `saveImage` path: those are material handed BACK to an image provider, and
 * they are normalised to PNG on purpose so every provider gets one predictable,
 * metadata-free format.
 *
 * sharp is required here. There is no degrade-to-the-original branch, because
 * uploading the original is the thing this function exists to prevent — if the
 * binary cannot load, the failure should be loud and at the point of cause.
