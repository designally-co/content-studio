/**
 * Whether the database has the schema this build expects.
 *
 * This exists because it was missed once, in the worst possible way. A release
 * added five columns and every article page 500'd with `column "origin" does
 * not exist` — while `/api/health` reported the database healthy, because
 * `select 1` succeeds perfectly well against a schema that is two migrations
 * behind the code querying it.
 *
 * Two things make that a silent failure rather than a loud one. Deployed
 * environments set `SKIP_DB_MIGRATE=1`, so nothing applies migrations on boot;
 * and when the migrator does run, `src/db/index.ts` deliberately swallows its
 * errors so a hiccup cannot take down every request. Both are defensible on
 * their own. Together they mean a schema change can ship, deploy green, and
 * break only the pages that touch the new column.
 *
 * The count of applied migrations against the count this build ships is enough
 * to catch it, and it is one cheap query. Unlike the Hub, this IS part of `ok`:
 * a database behind the code is not a degraded feature, it is pages that 500.
