/**
 * Writing the article, with no session check.
 *
 * The route still streams — that is its whole job, and an editor watching a
 * blank panel for fifty seconds is a worse product than one watching sentences
 * arrive. But the work either side of the stream (appending sources, stripping
 * em dashes, snapshotting the previous version, saving the row) is not about
 * streaming at all, and the autopilot runner needs every bit of it.
 *
 * So it lives here, and `onDelta` is optional: the route passes one and gets a
 * stream, the runner passes nothing and gets the finished text. Not in the
 * route's own module because a route handler cannot be imported as a function,
 * and not in a `"use server"` file because every exported async function in one
 * of those is a callable endpoint.
