/**
 * The shapes that cross between the server and the browser.
 *
 * THEY LIVE IN A MODULE OF THEIR OWN BECAUSE OF WHERE THEY ARE READ FROM. A
 * client component needs these names; the functions that produce them are
 * `server-only`, and the actions that wrap those are `"use server"`. Neither is
 * a safe place for a client import to point at, and re-exporting a type from a
 * `"use server"` file is worse than unsafe — it is broken:
 *
 *     ReferenceError: PublishToHubResult is not defined
 *     ReferenceError: TopicIdea is not defined
 *
 * That is production, on every page that loaded one of those modules. The
 * server-actions transform turns each export of such a file into a registered
 * server reference, and it does that to `export type { … }` as well — emitting
 * a runtime export of a name that only ever existed in the type system. The
 * build says nothing, because nothing is wrong until the module is evaluated.
 *
 * So the types are declared here, in a plain module with no directive of any
 * kind, and everyone — client components, server modules, actions — imports
 * them from here. There is no re-export to get wrong.
