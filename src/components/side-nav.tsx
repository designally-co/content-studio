                 fill, its ink, its weight AND its icon colour all at once —
                 four signals for one fact. It changes surface and nothing
                 else: same ink, same weight, same icon as every row beside it,
                 sitting on a grey two steps down from the rail. Hover is the
                 step between, so the pointer reads as a preview of selection
                 rather than as a different idea. */
