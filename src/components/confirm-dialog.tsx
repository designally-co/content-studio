/**
 * An irreversible thing, asked properly.
 *
 * IT WAS AN INLINE PANEL INSIDE THE CARD, which put a destructive button in
 * the same few hundred pixels as the menu that opens it — one stray click from
 * the trigger and the confirmation is already under the cursor. A confirmation
 * that appears where the pointer already is confirms nothing. Two of these
 * disappeared during review without anybody meaning to delete them.
 *
 * So it takes the screen: focus moves into it, Escape and the overlay cancel,
 * and Delete is somewhere the pointer has to travel to.
 *
 * THE BODY NAMES THE CONSEQUENCE, not the action. "Are you sure" asks the
 * reader to supply the stakes themselves, so each caller passes the one thing
 * worth knowing — what survives this and what does not.
