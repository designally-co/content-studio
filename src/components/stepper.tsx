  /* THE CURRENT STEP SITS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SCREEN, whatever step it is.
     Centring the whole list is a layout decision and it stops helping the
     moment the steps overflow: the row then begins at "Draft & edit" whichever
     stage you are on, so a phone at Publish opens showing two steps you have
     finished and not the one you are looking at.

     HALF A SCREEN OF PADDING AT EACH END IS WHAT MAKES IT POSSIBLE. Scrolling
     stops at the end of the content, so without it the last step can only ever
     reach the right edge — measured at 375px, "Publish" ran out of scroll 128px
     short of the middle. Padding gives the row somewhere to keep going, and the
     finished steps run off to the left as they should.

     The padding is applied here rather than in a class because it must not
     exist when everything fits: it would force a scroll onto a row that had no
     need of one, and turn the centred list into an off-centre one. So the
     natural width is measured first, with any previous padding cleared. */

         It was the latter until the labels shortened to Draft / Image /
         Publish, at which point all three fitted, the padding stopped being
         added, and `mx-auto` centred the ROW instead of the step — which put
         "Draft" at x=67 against a menu button whose right edge is 68, half
         inside the fade meant for steps scrolling away. Below `lg` the current
         step is always the thing in the middle of the screen, whether or not

       green as you advanced: five colours and three shapes to say which of
       three words you are on. All of it came out.

       What came back is the pill alone, in grey. Position and weight carry the
       rest: the steps read left to right, so what is behind you is behind you,
       and the ones you cannot reach yet are quieter still. No green, which was
       the only place in the product using it as chrome, and no tick — the
       Publish stage says it is published, in words, on the panel you are
       looking at when it matters. */
    /* CENTRED, AND IT SURVIVES OVERFLOW. `justify-center` on the scrolling
       element itself is the obvious way and the broken one: once the steps are
       wider than the phone, centring pushes the first one off the left edge
       into a region the scroll cannot reach. A `w-fit` list with auto margins
       centres while there is room and collapses those margins to nothing when
       there is not, so a narrow screen scrolls from the beginning. */
    /* EDGE TO EDGE, BY UNDOING THE PAGE GUTTER AND PAYING IT BACK AS PADDING.
       The bar this sits in is inset by 20px, so a step scrolling away stopped
       and vanished 20px in from the screen — an arbitrary line with nothing
       drawn on it, which reads as clipping rather than as more to come. The
       negative margin gives the scroll the whole width; the matching padding
       puts the steps back on the page's own left edge when they are at rest.
       Only below `lg`, where the row can actually overflow: pulling a full-bleed
       element out of a centred container on a wide screen risks giving the page
       a horizontal scroll of its own, for no gain.

       NO SCROLLBAR. Nothing here is aimed at with a pointer — the row moves by
       swipe, or it does not move at all because everything fits — and a bar
       under three words is a horizontal rule the design never asked for. Hiding
       it does not stop it scrolling. */

      /* HIDDEN, NOT AUTO — AND STILL A SCROLL CONTAINER. This is a progress
         indicator, not a carousel: there is nothing to find by swiping it, and
         a row that slides under the thumb invites a gesture whose only possible
         outcome is putting the current step somewhere it should not be, with no
         way back but changing stage. `hidden` refuses the gesture while leaving
         `scrollLeft` writable, which is the whole positioning mechanism —
         `clip` would have read as the same intent and silently broken it, by
         not making an element a scroll container at all.
         Focus still scrolls a step into view, which is the one case where
         moving without a gesture is correct.

         FADED AT BOTH ENDS, because on a phone a button sits over each of
         them — the menu on the left, the stage's forward action on the right —
         and a step passing behind one was being sliced mid-word by an opaque
         disc. "…mages" reads as a typo rather than as something that carries on
         off-screen. Off above `lg`, where neither button exists. */

             Grey rather than orange, which is reserved for the thing you press.
             A step you are already on is not an action.

             AND THE HOVER NOW EXISTS. It was `bg-sunken`, which is #f8f8f7 —
