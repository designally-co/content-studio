/**
 * Which model does the fast work, and which does the careful work.
 *
 * A NATIVE `select`, LIKE THE ROUTINE SHEET'S. The Radix Select these used
 * could not be opened at all from inside the settings sheet: a Select is itself
 * a modal layer, and nesting one in a Dialog leaves `pointer-events: none`
 * stranded on `document.body` when the two layers disagree about who is
 * closing. Measured with the sheet open — body pointer-events none, the trigger
 * unclickable, one combobox stuck reporting data-state="open" with nothing on
 * screen. Not a styling fault, and not fixable by styling.
 *
 * The routine sheet had already answered this: a plain `select` with the native
 * arrow suppressed and a chevron drawn beside it. It cannot strand anything,
 * it opens on a phone the way a phone expects, and it is the control this
 * product's other sheet already uses.
 *
 * Controlled, with hidden inputs carrying the values: React resets a form after
 * a server action, which would otherwise snap both fields back to their
 * mount-time defaults and make a saved choice look like it had reverted.
