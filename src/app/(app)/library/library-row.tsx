 * One article, as a row.
 *
 * A TABLE, BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS A LIST OF THE SAME THING. Cards give every
 * article a picture the size of a postcard and then repeat four labels beneath
 * it, so twelve articles are twelve blocks to read rather than twelve lines to
 * scan. A row puts the same four facts in the same four places every time,
 * which is what makes a column comparable — and which article was edited last,
 * or which are still drafts, is a question you answer by running your eye down
 * one column rather than reading each card.
 *
 * The thumbnail stays, at row height. It is the fastest way to recognise an
 * article you already know, and it costs a column rather than a paragraph.
 *
 * ALL OF WHICH STOPS BEING TRUE ON A PHONE — see LibraryItem below.

/**
 * One article, as a list item — the phone's version of the row above.
 *
 * COLUMNS NEED WIDTH, AND A PHONE HAS NONE TO GIVE. The table degrades by
 * dropping columns as the screen narrows, which works until the last two are
 * Title and Status: at 375px the title had about seven characters before the
 * ellipsis, so a page of ten articles read "Buildin…", "The Op…", "Why S…" —
 * ten thumbnails and ten copies of the word Published. The one fact you came to
 * find was the one fact the layout would not show.
 *
 * So it stops being a table, and then it stops carrying the columns too. The
 * title takes the full width and two lines if it needs them, and that is all.
 * Direction, Updated and Status were each argued down here in turn on the
 * reasoning that a phone should not lose what the table showed — but the table
 * had already dropped the first two at this width, and the third was a line of
 * type under every single article to mark the state that most of them share.
 * A list of names you can actually read beats a list of names you cannot with
 * a label underneath each one.
 *
 * The checkbox stays. Per-row delete is revealed on hover, which a touch screen
 * never does, so selecting and using the bar above is the only way to delete
 * anything here — removing the tick would remove the capability.
