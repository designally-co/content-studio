 * one of them: the header's tick has to know what every row is doing, and the
 * bar has to count them. A checkbox that owned its own state could not answer
 * either question.
 *
 * IT IS SCOPED TO THE PAGE YOU CAN SEE. Ten rows are shown at a time, and the
 * selection is cleared by paging — carrying a hidden selection across pages
 * means a Delete button reporting a number you cannot check against anything on
 * screen, which is exactly the situation where a bulk delete goes wrong.
