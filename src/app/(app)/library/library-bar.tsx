/**
 * Library's phone bar: the page's name on the menu button's line, and the one
 * control the page actually needs there.
 *
 * SEARCH IS THE WHOLE BAR, NOT A BUTTON BESIDE ONE. The desktop filter row is
 * a search box and three selects — direction, status, sort — which on a phone
 * became a two-column grid of dropdowns occupying most of the screen above a
 * list of ten articles. The selects are how you narrow a table you can see all
 * of at once; on a phone you are looking for one article and you know its name.
 *
 * So the phone gets search and nothing else, and it is not even permanently on
 * screen: the bar shows the page's name until you press the disc, then becomes
 * the field. The desktop bar is untouched — this replaces it below `lg`, it
 * does not reduce it.
