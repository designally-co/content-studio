                       rather than as a mark. The singular is the same idea
                       drawn once — and solid rather than outlined, because a
                       four-pointed outline at 16px is mostly the hole in the
                       middle: the stroke has to describe eight edges around a
                       shape too small to hold them, and what survives is a
                       blur. Filled, it is one silhouette at any size.

                       AND NO STROKE AT ALL. Filled AND stroked, a 1.5px
                       outline runs around all eight edges of a 16px star and
                       fattens its waist until the concave curves between the
                       points close up — at which point it is a plus sign. The
                       fill alone keeps those curves, which are the entire
                       difference between a star and a cross.

                       `fill` and `strokeWidth` as attributes rather than
                       classes, since lucide ships `fill="none"` and a stroke
                       width on the svg itself, and a utility would be fighting
                       an attribute. 20px, half the disc, because the taper
                       between the points is the whole shape and it needs room
                       to be seen — at 16 it is a cross with soft corners. */
