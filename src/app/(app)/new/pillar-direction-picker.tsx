          /* UPWARD, AND ALLOWED TO MOVE. `side="bottom"` was right when the
             composer floated in the middle of the screen; the dock sits at the
             FOOT of a phone now, so opening downwards put the menu below the
             fold — and `avoidCollisions={false}` was the instruction not to
             correct for exactly that. Both were true of a layout that no
             longer exists.

             ALWAYS UPWARD, THOUGH — never sometimes. Left to decide, Radix
             flips to whichever side has room, and "room" depends on how tall
             the list is: Design has ten directions and opened downward, New
             Update has three and opened up. Same control, same press, the menu
             appearing on a different side each time, and nothing the reader
             did caused it. A menu that moves is a menu you have to find.

             So the side is fixed and the HEIGHT gives instead. Capped to the
             space Radix measured above the trigger, a list that would not have
             fitted scrolls rather than jumping to the other side — which is
             the trade worth making, because a scrollbar is a thing you can see
             and a flip is a thing you can only be surprised by. */

             much screen may this take" — the wrong question for a list, whose
             own unit is the row. At 60svh the menu was a different length on
             every display and on a tall one it never scrolled at all; seven
             rows is the same list everywhere, long enough to take in at a
             glance and short enough that the eighth is obviously below.

             `--radix-…-available-height` stays as the outer bound: seven rows
             is what it WANTS, and on a screen with room for four it takes
             four rather than running off the top. */

              touching its own border. Inset by the panel's own `p-2` it sits
              beside the rows it scrolls, which is what it is for.
