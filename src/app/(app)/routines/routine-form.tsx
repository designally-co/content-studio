 * The same form creates and edits — the only difference is a hidden id and

 * eventually stop being identical.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS BEFORE WHEN IT RUNS. Name, then description, then the schedule:
 * the description used to sit at the bottom under the heading "Prompt", which
 * put the sentence explaining a routine below every mechanical detail of it.
 * You decide what a thing is for before you decide what time it happens.
 *
 * THE SCHEDULE IS ONE ROW THAT CHANGES SHAPE. Cadence first, then only the
 * fields that cadence actually needs — a weekday appears for a weekly routine
 * and for nothing else, and a routine run by hand shows no time at all,
 * because there is no time at which it happens.
