- Lens feel and distance, where the light comes from and how hard it is, what is sharp and what falls away, the time of day the room suggests.
- Specific ordinary detail — a cooling coffee, a cable half-coiled, a second monitor turned away, papers that have been moved. That is what makes a photograph read as real.
- Do not call it art, conceptual, surreal, editorial, or a metaphor. It is a photograph of something that happened.

Then write \`scene\`: a picture OF THE SAME KIND, about this article's subject. Another instance of that sort of photograph, not that one. That correspondence is the whole job — an image LIKE the reference, not one merely inspired by it.

THE SAME KIND INCLUDES WHETHER ANYBODY IS IN IT. If the photograph in front of you has no person in it, your scene must have none — describe printed material, objects on a surface, a screen, a room. Do not put a designer at a desk into a scene the reference answered with a flat-lay.`

An article about designers using AI is a designer working — not a glowing brain, a robot hand, or a floating interface. An article about a brand audit is the printed brand material itself: stationery and packaging laid out on a table, a wall of pinned logo variations, a colour book open beside a swatch fan — no person required, and none unless the reference has one. An article about type licensing is a drawer of metal type in a workshop, or somebody at a screen with a foundry's licence page open. If a reader could not say what is in the picture, the scene is not doing its job. Ordinary and slightly untidy beats styled.

Write \`alternateScenes\`: ${Math.max(params.variantCount - 1, 0)} other real scenes from the same world. Not the same moment from another angle — a different one: a different part of the work, a different arrangement, a different room, a different time of day. An editor is choosing between the finished photographs, so two scenes that would produce the same picture are one wasted choice.

Write \`photoQuery\`: three to six words to search a stock photo library with, describing the SITUATION and nothing else — "designer working at desk laptop", "brand stationery flat lay table", "typographer inspecting metal type", "colour swatches and print samples". No brand names, no abstract nouns, no adjectives about mood. This finds the reference photograph the finished image is matched against, so it must describe something a photographer would actually have shot.

2. Names the problem before presenting Designally or a solution.
3. Uses short, direct sentences and active voice.

6. Reinforces the selected message pillar naturally rather than forcing a pitch.
7. Uses a low-pressure next step appropriate to the selected article objective.
8. Makes only supported claims and does not invent proof.
9. Uses concrete names, examples, and details instead of generic claims.

11. Links supplied sources contextually and does not invent citations.
12. Maintains editorial momentum without repetitive summaries, listicle filler, or generic transitions.
