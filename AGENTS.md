# Rules this repository learned the hard way

**Never re-export a type from a `"use server"` file.** Not `export type { X }`,
not `export { type X }`. The server-actions transform turns every export of
such a module into a registered server reference — including a type-only one —
and emits a runtime export of a name that exists only in the type system. The
build passes. The module then throws `ReferenceError: X is not defined` the
first time it is evaluated, which in production means every page that imports
it answers 500. A local type alias (`export type X = { … }`) is fine; it is the
re-export of an imported name that breaks.

Shapes that a client component and a server module both need go in a plain
module with no directive — `src/lib/pipeline/views.ts` is the one that exists —
and everyone imports them from there.

**Verify the built app, not just the build.** `next build` succeeded on the
change that shipped the above. Run `next start` and load the pages the change
touches before calling it done.
