/**
 * Replace the local articles with production's, files and all.
 *
 * Local development runs on embedded PGlite with seed data, so the pipeline is
 * usually exercised against three invented articles. This pulls the real ones
 * down instead, which is the difference between testing a layout against
 * "word word word" and testing it against an article somebody published.
 *
 * DESTRUCTIVE, LOCALLY ONLY. It deletes every local project and everything
 * hanging off one. It never writes to production — the production connection is
 * opened read-only in intent and only ever SELECTed from.
 *
 * TWO THINGS MAKE THIS MORE THAN A COPY.
 *
 * Foreign keys do not line up. The two databases were seeded independently, so
 * their categories share all 34 names and NOT ONE id, and the same person has a
 * different user id in each. Copying `category_id` verbatim would either fail
 * the constraint or, worse, point an article at whatever local row happened to
 * take that id. Both columns are remapped: categories by name, the author to
 * whoever exists locally.
 *
 * Image bytes do not travel either. Rows carry `supabase:` paths, and local has
 * no Supabase credentials — `resolveImage` would return null for every one of
 * them and the Library would be a wall of broken thumbnails. Each file is
 * downloaded into `data/images/` and its path rewritten to `local:`, so the copy
 * is self-contained and keeps working with the network off.
 *
 * Ids are otherwise preserved, because things point at each other by id:
 * `images.reference_ids` names the references a cover came from, and
 * `inputs_json.coverImageId` names the image an article publishes.
