   * work simply did not run in production.

   * node_modules entire, `.so` and all. Verify after any Next upgrade by
   * grepping a route's `.nft.json` for `libvips` and looking for a BINARY, not

   * sharp's `.node` binding is traced automatically; the 17MB shared object it
   * links against is not, because it is loaded by dlopen at runtime and no
   * static analysis can see the call. Without this, every sharp call on Vercel
   * died with `ERR_DLOPEN_FAILED: libvips-cpp.so` while working perfectly on a
   * developer's machine, where the library happens to be installed.
   *
   * `serverExternalPackages: ["sharp"]` does NOT fix it — tried, and the trace
   * was byte-identical. This is the only mechanism that works.
   *
   * IT ALSO USED NOT TO WORK. On Next 15 under Turbopack this option was
   * silently ignored, which is why the app spent months treating sharp as
   * unavailable in production and degrading around it. Re-verified on 16.2.10:
   * the binary is traced and lands in the output. Check it again after a Next
   * upgrade, by grepping a route's `.nft.json` for `libvips` and looking for a
   * `.so`/`.dylib` rather than the package.json beside it.
   *
   * Listed per route rather than globally: 17MB on every function would be
   * carried by the ones that never touch an image. These four are the entries
   * that can reach sharp — the pipeline's server actions, the autopilot that
   * generates without an editor, logo compositing, and the health probe that
   * reports whether any of it can run.
   *
   * THE KEYS ARE GLOBS, so a literal `[id]` is a CHARACTER CLASS and matches
   * "i" or "d" — never the segment. `"/api/brand-image/[id]"` looked exactly
   * right, built without complaint, and shipped no library at all. Dynamic
   * segments have to be reached with `**`, and a route group stays in the path.
   * Verified per route by reading each `.nft.json` after a build; the four
   * below carry the binary and nothing else does.
